# GALLERY OF D0000000000000M

This is a sample Gallery modal with infinite scrolling and some slightly-cool animation on transition. One simply will never get tired of a bold entrance.
This sample is built and bundled from ground up with following tech stacks and dependencies:

  - ReactJS, oh year the React we love, version 15++
  - Webpack, manually configured from ground up.
  - Semantic-ui (gosh I hate it)
  - A third-lib called "React-infinite-scroller"
  - Fake RestAPI from [JSONPlaceholder][Fks]
  - Some dumb images from [Lorempixel][Lpx]
 
Open package.json for details. 
...or read on!
## Installation
Nothing special, just usual routine:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/vutran1710/doom_gallery
$ cd doom_gallery
$ yarn
$ yarn start
```
or if you just want to dig with node...
```sh
$ npm i
$ npm start
```
optimize the bundle with:
```sh
$ npm run build
```
For the moment, there is no code-coverage. Sorry for that. Will be implemented later.

### Todos

 - Write Tests
 - I dont know, maybe go back to sleep then?
